        <p>“Formula One was just cool. I loved racing, all types of racing, but from a young age, Formula One was the noise and everything, and that’s what I was drawn to. I already knew when I was younger, the coolest guys are in F1… not that NASCAR drivers aren’t cool, but that was always what I had in my head!” – Daniel Ricciardo</p>

          <h3>Adaptability</h3>
          <p>Things change all the time in F1, for example the weather, equipment and team mates. Even little things can make a difference to how a driver performs. Those that can’t handle these changes quickly and easily just won’t succeed.</p>

          <h3 style="color:#000000">Focus</h3>
          <p>As a driver your mind status changes from race to race. When you win, you go into the next race with bags of confidence, and likewise if you have crashed or come in last, it’s going to knock you. There are always external factors that are going to affect your mind set, but its how you handle it that makes the difference.</p>

          <h3 style="color:#000000">Professionalism</h3>
          <p>When a driver is able to speak with the same level of knowledge and understanding as the engineers, this shows complete professionalism and helps the engineers react faster to what the driver needs. Likewise when not driving, drivers must be able to communicate articulately to media and sponsors who are integral to the financing of the sport.</p>
